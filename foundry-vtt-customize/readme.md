# Foundry VTT UI Customizations

These are some custom UI styles for Foundry VTT to suit my campaigns.
The original styles and idea come from [/u/bass-blowfish](https://www.reddit.com/user/bass-blowfish/) and have been slightly modified. I take no ownership of the original styles and this repository is purely used as a backup in case an update of Foundry wipes the `styles.css` file.

# Usage
Add the styles that are provided in the `styles.css` file to the bottom of the `styles.css` file that is used by Foundry VTT. This file is located at `foundryvtt/resources/app/public/css/style.css`. You will need to have administrator rights to make changes to this file depending on where it has been installed.

To use the background that is supplied, navigate to `foundryvtt/resources/app/public/ui` directory and create a new `backgrounds` directory. Copy and paste the `strahd-cover.jpg` into the new `backgrounds `directory. Likewise, copy the `dnd-logo.svg` file to the `foundryvtt/resources/app/public/ui` directory.
